* Flagrant - CLI-driven feature flagging system

Feature flagging niche is long time filled in with excellent solutions like [[https://www.getunleash.io/][Unleash]] or [[https://www.flagsmith.com/][Flagsmith]], so why yet another app on top of this cake? Flagrant has an ambition to become a Redis of feature flagging - small, reliable and completely CLI driven server providing all that's needed to keep features under control. Namely, it's supposed to bring in:

- multiple environments (prod, dev, test, etc)
- multivariant features
- segment overrides
- identity overrides
- scheduled on/off
- analytics
- client libraries for rust/jvm/js

As it's written in Rust, Flagrant comes with low-level resource utilisation and _blazingly fast_ mode switched on by default ðŸ˜ƒ

* Architecture
To keep things simple yet still allow for extensibilty, code has been structured into following modules (crates)

- =flagrant= - core logic (requests distribution among others)
- =flagrant-types= core types shared across all other modules
- =flagrant-api= HTTP server exposing crucial endpoints both for clients and management
- =flagrant-cli= a command-line interface to communicate with server
- =flagrant-client= a client library ensuring seamless communication between client- and server-side, with caching, etc.
